# Performance Optimizations for SPIMS Frontend

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve mobile Lighthouse performance scores.

## 🚀 Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Bundle Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented manual chunk splitting in Vite config
- **Lazy Loading**: All routes and heavy components are now lazy-loaded
- **Tree Shaking**: Optimized imports to reduce bundle size
- **Vendor Chunks**: Separated vendor libraries into dedicated chunks

### 2. JavaScript Execution Time Reduction
- **Lazy Loading AOS**: Animate on Scroll library is now loaded conditionally
- **Optimized Toast**: react-hot-toast is lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle
- **Three.js Optimization**: 3D components are loaded only when needed
- **Query Client Optimization**: Reduced refetch frequency and retries

### 3. Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- **Conditional 3D Loading**: Three.js components load after 2s delay on mobile
- **Reduced Animation**: AOS animations disabled on mobile devices
- **Optimized Canvas**: Reduced device pixel ratio and disabled antialiasing on mobile
- **Delayed Non-Critical Features**: Heavy features load after initial render

### 4. Caching Strategy
- **Service Worker**: Implemented comprehensive caching strategy
- **Static Asset Caching**: Critical assets cached immediately
- **API Response Caching**: Successful API responses cached for offline use
- **Dynamic Caching**: Runtime assets cached as needed

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- **Core Web Vitals Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB
- **Performance Metrics Display**: Development tool for monitoring metrics
- **Bundle Analysis**: Tools for analyzing bundle size and composition

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- JavaScript execution time: 4.4s
- Total CPU time: 6,206ms
- Script evaluation: 4,002ms

### After Optimization
- **Estimated 60-70% reduction** in initial JavaScript execution time
- **Faster First Contentful Paint** due to reduced bundle size
- **Improved Largest Contentful Paint** through lazy loading
- **Better Time to Interactive** with optimized loading strategies

## 🛠️ Build Commands

```bash
# Standard build
npm run build

# Production build with optimizations
npm run build:prod

# Bundle analysis
npm run bundle:analyze

# Performance check with Lighthouse
npm run performance:check
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files Modified

1. **vite.config.ts**: Added code splitting, optimization settings
2. **main.tsx**: Lazy loading AOS, service worker registration
3. **App.tsx**: Route-based code splitting, lazy loading
4. **HeroSection.tsx**: Conditional 3D loading, mobile optimizations
5. **useOptimizedToast.ts**: Lazy loading toast notifications
6. **sw.js**: Service worker for caching strategy

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Features

### Conditional Loading
- Three.js components load only on desktop or after delay on mobile
- AOS animations disabled on mobile devices
- Heavy libraries loaded progressively

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time Core Web Vitals tracking
- Development performance overlay
- Bundle size monitoring

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached immediately
- API responses cached for offline use
- Dynamic content cached as needed

## 🎯 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without heavy features
2. **Resource Prioritization**: Critical resources load first
3. **Conditional Loading**: Heavy features load based on device capabilities
4. **Caching Strategy**: Comprehensive caching for better performance
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of performance metrics

## 📈 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Metrics to Track
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor bundle sizes after dependency updates
- Review and optimize new components
- Update caching strategies as needed
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Service Worker Not Registering**: Check HTTPS requirement
2. **Lazy Loading Not Working**: Verify dynamic imports are correct
3. **Performance Monitor Not Showing**: Check development mode or localStorage setting

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable performance monitoring
localStorage.setItem('showPerformance', 'true')

# Disable performance monitoring
localStorage.removeItem('showPerformance')

# Clear service worker cache
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  registrations.forEach(registration => registration.unregister())
})
```
